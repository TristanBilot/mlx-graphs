# MLX-graphs

MLX-graphs is a library for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) built upon Apple's MLX.

## Work in progress 🚧

We just started the development of this lib, with the aim to integrate it within [mx-explore](https://github.com/ml-explore).

The lib follows the Message Passing Neural Network ([MPNN](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gilmer17a/gilmer17a.pdf)) architecture to build arbitrary GNNs on top of it, similarly as in [PyG](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric).

### Installation (build from source)
To build and install `mlx-graphs` from source start by cloning the github repo
```
git clone git@github.com:TristanBilot/mlx-graphs.git && cd mlx-graphs
```
We're currently using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as a package manager. So make sure you have it installed.

Create a new environment (you can use your desired python version)
```
poetry env use python3.12
```
Install packages and activate the env
```
poetry install --only prd
poetry shell
```

#### Build for development

```
poetry install --only dev
```

(Optional) Install a local version of mlx for development
```
poetry add --editable path/to/mlx_package
poetry install
```

### Contributing

##### Pre-commit hooks (temporary)
Make sure to run [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure code quality. To do that, simply install them by running
```
pre-commit install
```
> Note: This aims to be a temporary measure until CI/CD is in place.


## Why running GNNs on my Mac?

By leveraging Apple Silicon, running GNNs enjoys accelerated GPU computation ⚡️ and unified memory architecture. This eliminates device data transfers and enables leveraging all available memory to store large graphs directly on your Mac's GPU.

## Why contributing?

We are at an early stage of the development of the lib, which means your contributions can have a large impact!
Everyone is welcome to contribute, just open an issue 📝 with your idea 💡 and we'll work together on the implementation ✨.
